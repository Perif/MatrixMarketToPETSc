MatrixMarketToPETSc
===================

MatrixMarket file converter to PETSc bin format is a small software written in C and PETSc library to convert, as its name suggest, Matrix Market files to PETSc binary format. 
This is extremely useful if you have to benchmark your codes written in PETSc using standard matrices coming from [Matrix Market] [1] or the [University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection] [2]


### Requirements :

Working [PETSc] [3] installation (I'm using petsc-3.3-p2)


Compile with scalar type complex if you intend to convert complex matrices (flag --with-scalar-type=complex during configure stage).


### Installation :

Nothing much to do but : **make**

### How to use :

**Important** : You must remove all comments but dimensions in your matrix market file. I'll provide some workaround someday...


*./converter -matrix\_file matrix\_market_file.mtx*

or 

*./converter -vector\_file matrix\_market\_vector\_file.mtx (typically ends with _b.mtx)*

or 

*./converter -matrix\_file matrix\_market\_file.mtx -vector\_file matrix_market_vector_file.mtx*


The results will be placed in separate PETSc binary files (in gz)
